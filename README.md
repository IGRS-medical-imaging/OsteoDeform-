<h1 align="center">OsteoDeform: Osteophyte-Aware Shape Deformations of Distal Femur Models for Surgical Planning in Total Knee Arthroplasty
</h1>

<p  align="center">  
  
`Abstract`. Image-guided robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) using Computed Tomography (CT) scans with the assistance of 3D femur models, has been proven to improve surgical outcomes as compared to traditional TKA procedures. The occurrence of osteophytes or bone spurs at the knee joint is attributed mainly to bone loss and ligament instability. This significantly alters the anatomy, making surgical planning
inaccurate.
`Problem Statement`: Given an osteophytic 3D distal femur model, removal of osteophytes during surgical planning facilitates accurate knee segmentation and precise kinematic computation, thus improving TKA
outcomes. 
`Method`: We propose OsteoDeform, a geometric learning framework specifically to remove osteophytes from 3D femur models. We generate the [OSTFemur-Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/15718534) containing paired osteophytic and healthy distal
femur models on which OsteoDeform is trained.
`Results`: OsteoDeform effectively removes over 70.7% of the distal femoral osteophytes while achieving an average morphometric error of only 0.022Â±0.05 mm, thereby preserving the anatomical integrity of the distal femur

  <summary><i>Osteophyte Removal</i></summary>

  - Osteophyte removal is a standard procedure performed routinely during the surgery to restore soft-tissue balance and improve knee biomechanics. Failure to remove osteophytes can result in unequal flexion along the medial-lateral axis and extension gaps, affecting the alignment and functionality of soft tissues in the region.

<summary><i>OsteoDeform</i></summary>
  
  -  OsteoDeform is a neural deformation-based framework for osteophyte removal. OsteoDeform employs Neural Flow Deformers (NFD) to generate smooth transformations, deforming osteophytic femoral shapes toward pre-diseased anatomical states.

<details>
You can download the dataset from the following link:

ðŸ”— [OSTFemur-Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/15718534)

The OSTFemur-dataset has 495 osteophytic femur models as PLY meshes with their corresponding healthy femurs.  
55 healthy femurs have 9 osteophytic femur variations each; every healthy femur model has three Grade 4 (Severe), four Grade 3 (moderate) and two Grade 2 (mild) osteophytic femur models.

  - The OSTFemur-dataset is split into train, validation and test data in the 80:10:10 split: 
    train - Train data (395 models)
    val - Validation data (50 models)
    test - Test data (50 models)

<h1 align="center">OsteoDeform: Removal of Distal Femoral Osteophytes using Neural Flow Deformers for Total Knee Arthroplasty</h1>

<p  align="center">  
  
`Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)` using `Computed Tomography (CT)` scans for image guided intervention with the assistance of 3D knee models, has been proven to improve surgical outcomes when compared to manual TKA procedures. The occurrence of `osteophytes` or bone spurs at the knee joint is attributed mainly to bone loss and ligament instability. This significantly alters the anatomy, hindering segmentation and causing erroneous computation of distal and proximal femur cuts, thus making `preoperative planning` inaccurate. This could lead to incorrect `sizing and placement of implants`, consequently deteriorating the clinical progress. The proposed OsteoDeform is designed to remove bone spurs from 3D knee models, thereby improving the surgical outcomes in image-guided TKA.OsteoDeform utilizes `neural flow deformers` on an in-house generated dataset OSTFemur-dataset. It effectively removes over 70.7% of the distal femoral osteophytes. A `femoral morphometric analysis` conducted for clinical validation showed an average morphometric error of only 0.022 Â± 0.05, thereby showing that the femoral contours are preserved and closely resemble its pre-osteophytic stage.

  <summary><i>Osteophyte Removal</i></summary>

  - Osteophyte removal is a standard procedure performed routinely during the surgery to restore soft-tissue balance and improve knee biomechanics. Failure to remove osteophytes can result in unequal flexion along the medial-lateral axis and extension gaps, affecting the alignment and functionality of soft tissues in the region.

<summary><i>OsteoDeform</i></summary>
  
  -  OsteoDeform is a neural deformation-based framework for osteophyte removal. OsteoDeform employs Neural Flow Deformers (NFD) to generate smooth transformations, deforming osteophytic femoral shapes toward pre-diseased anatomical states.

You can download the dataset from the following link:

ðŸ”— [OSTFemur-Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ulmbzvWUVoI6JJHFxmsbB9RR39qNuSak?usp=sharing)

The OSTFemur-dataset has 495 osteophytic femur models as PLY meshes with their corresponding healthy femurs.  
55 healthy femurs have 9 osteophytic femur variations each; every healthy femur model has three Grade 4 (Severe), four Grade 3 (moderate) and two Grade 2 (mild) osteophytic femur models.

  - The OSTFemur-dataset is split into train, validation and test data in the 80:10:10 split: 
    train - Train data (395 models)
    val - Validation data (50 models)
    test - Test data (50 models)
